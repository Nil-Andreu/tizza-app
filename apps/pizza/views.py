# Django has layers that you request and response goes through when they enter and exist your app
# - AuthentificationMiddleware: ensures that request.user object exist and you can access it.
# If the user is logged in then it will be populated with the user object. If not,
# then an anonymous user will be sitting on this attribute. Oftentimes it is very convenient
